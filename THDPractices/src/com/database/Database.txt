Welcome to JAVA - JDBC hands-on practice

First of all you need the mysql connector jar, in this example it is located in "src/com/database/jars", in order to use the java classes in the connector, you need to link the jar to the project, double-click on the project and go "Settings/Libraries", also you need an MYSQL instance, for this example, we have a free cloud MYSQL instance and a generated database name, user and password.

For connect your cloud database you need this information:

>server url: example -> db4free.net
>server port: example -> 3306 (MYSQL default)
>database name: example -> thd_ho_test
>username: example -> thd_ho_test
>password: example -> h4nd50n3

It does not matter if the database is empty, you can always reset the database information with the script we have prepared for this hands-on. It is located on "src/com/database/scripts" and the filename is "Init.sql".
